# AmplifyApp
An app for Android that performs simple circuit analysis.


# Usage
Users will be able to enter information about their circuit in to the application and the app will perform the circuit analysis and solve for the unknown values.  It is vital to help solve for voltage, resistance and current. This is a simple application that shows the relationship between the three major numerical components of a circuit. Shown first is the main page you will come to when you open the app which gives you a nice warm welcome to the experience we are going to take you on. It gives you the option to solve for Voltage Current or Resistance. Now depending on which you want to solve a new page appears. 

When you click the "Voltage" button on the main page, you are taken to a new screen. The first thing you need to do is enter the current. Then, enter your first resistor value. At the bottom of the screen there are two options to now choose from, add a resistor in series or add a group of parallel resistors. If you want to add a resistor in series, click that button and a second resistor will appear to allow you to enter that value in. We can continue to add resistors, assuming that is the circuit you want to solve for. On the other hand, if you want to add a group of parallel resistors, click this button from the "Solve for Voltage" secrenn and be brought to a new parallel resistors group page. When you are done entering resistors and their values, click solve to be taken to the results page which uniformly display the values for each of the three components.

When you click the "Current" button on the main page, you are taken to a new page trying to solve for the current. Now this page is going to work in a very similar fashion to the voltage page but the Voltage value is needed, along with the number and value of resistors, as before. Itâ€™s the same idea that went into the last page and gives you the ability to have some fun with what you are adding in to the circuit. After the resistors have been added, click the solve button again and  the same results page is shown, now outputting all three components with these new values that have been entered for this circuit.

When you click the "Resistance" button on the main page, you are again taken to a new page, now solving for the total Resistance. This scenario is significantly simpler, as the need to add all the additional resistors is gone. The voltage and the current of the circuit are the two values that are needed to be able to solve this circuit. Again, click solve at the bottom and get taken to that output page with all of our results. 

This application tailors to a wide variety of people and really make things simple when trying to solve for something complicated, such as a circuit. 
Please dont be shy, give it a try.
